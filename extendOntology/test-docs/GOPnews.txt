The GOP-controlled House is using a catchall spending bill not just to cut President Barack Obama's budget but to assault his health care overhaul, global warming policy and efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay.

The House worked deep into Saturday morning toward a final vote to pass the bill, as Republicans won vote after vote protecting various industries from regulations Republicans deemed were a drag on business.

The measure faced a veto threat and implacable opposition from majority Democrats in the Senate even before the GOP amendments adopted Thursday, Friday and early Saturday morning pushed the bill further and further to the right on health care and environmental policy.

Changes rammed through on Friday would shield greenhouse-gas polluters and privately owned colleges from federal regulators, block a plan to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, and bar the government from shutting down mountaintop mines it believes will cause too much water pollution, siding with business groups over environmental activists and federal regulators in almost every instance.
